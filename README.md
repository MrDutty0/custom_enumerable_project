# Custom Enumerable Project

## Introduction
This repository complements the Custom Enumerables Project in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes.This project aimed to deepen my understanding of blocks and procs while reinforcing my knowledge of enumerable methods in Ruby.

## Methods
Below is a list of methods implemented as part of the Custom Enumerables Project:

- `Enumerable#my_each`
- `Enumerable#my_each_with_index`
- `Enumerable#my_select`
- `Enumerable#my_all?`
- `Enumerable#my_any?`
- `Enumerable#my_none?`
- `Enumerable#my_count`
- `Enumerable#my_map`
- `Enumerable#my_inject`

These methods are located in the `lib/my_enumerables.rb` file. Each method has an associated spec file in the `spec` directory to ensure its correctness.
